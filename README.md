Excited to Share My Latest Project: Credit Card Financial Dashboard! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’³
Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that Iâ€™ve recently completed a comprehensive project where I developed a Credit Card Financial Dashboard. This project has been a great learning journey, combining data analysis and visualization skills. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the steps involved:


1. Data Wrangling: wrangled data from CSV files into a SQL database, then connected that database to Power BI for seamless data access.

2. Power Up with Power Query: transformed and cleaned the data in Power Query Editor, ensuring it was ready for analysis.

3. The Magic of DAX: created new columns and insightful measures using DAX functions, unlocking the power of the data.

4. Dual Dashboards for Double Insights: built two distinct dashboards:
Credit Card Transaction Report: Detailed analysis of transaction volume, types, amounts, and trends.

Credit Card Customer Report: Customer demographics, spending behavior, credit limits, and targeted insights.

5. Visualization Powerhouse: Packed each dashboard with charts, KPIs, and other visuals to make the data easily understandable.
